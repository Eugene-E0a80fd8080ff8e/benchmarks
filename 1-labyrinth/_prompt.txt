Make a labyrinth game of cube blocks.
Use this map:

```
XXXXXXXXXX
Xs.....XXX
XXXXXX.XXX
XXXXXX.XXX
XXX......X
X.X......X
X.X......X
X.XX.XXX.X
X........X
XXXXXXXXXX
```

- dot '.' - is the empty space, player can walk through
- 'X' is a wall
- 's' is a starting point, otherwise similar to '.'. 

Assume all blockes are 1x1x1 meters

Assume player's height is 1.7 meters.

Make usual WASD+mouse controls.

Use three.js
Store everything into a single file: css, js and html. 
Name that file labyrinth-ds32r.html . Do not read other files.

use this three.js :
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
