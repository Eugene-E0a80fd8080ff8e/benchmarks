```javascript
const worldmap =
String.raw`XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
X..............X
X.../.......\..X
X..............X
XX......X......X
X+../...X......X
XX......X......X
X..............X
X......./.../..X
X..............X
X..............X
X...\...\......X
X..XXXXXXX.....X
X.s............X
X..............X
XXXXXXXXXXXX*XXX`;
```

"X" - wall block. Its size is 1x1x1 meters.

"." - empty space.

"+" - the place in the wall, where the laser is shining from.

"/" and "\" - those are mirrors in two different states. Mirrors are installed in 45 or -45 degrees so that they change direction of the laser by 90 degrees.
45 and -45 are two states or the mirror. User can interact with mirrors and change its states.


If there is a mirror in front of the user, closer than 2 meters, it should get highlighted.

Once mirror is highlighted, the user may press the action button "E" to toggle mirror's state. 

Mirrors should look like mirrors.

"*" - this is the target for the light. When the laser shines into it, the user have solved the puzzle, the game is over. Let user know about it.

The laser should be a visible line.

"s" - starting point, where the player should spawned at the beginning.
