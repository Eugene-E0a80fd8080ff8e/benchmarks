Make a labyrinth game of cube blocks.
Use this map:

```
XXXXXXXXXX
Xs.....XXX
XXXXXX.XXX
XXXXXX.XXX
XXX......X
X.X......X
X.X......X
X.XX.XXX.X
X........X
XXXXXXXXXX
```

- dot '.' - is the empty space, player can walk through
- 'X' is a wall
- 's' is a starting point, otherwise similar to '.'. 

Assume all blockes are 1x1x1 meters

Assume player's height is 1.7 meters.

Make usual WASD+mouse controls. 
When a user pulls mouse down, the viewport should look down, at the "ground". When a user pushes mouse up, the viewport should look up, at the "ski".

Use three.js
Store everything into a single file: css, js and html. Name that file as OUTPUT_FILE says . 

Ignore all other files. Do not read other files , not even AGENTS.md .

use this three.js :
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.1/build/three.js"></script>
